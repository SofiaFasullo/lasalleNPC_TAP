Level Up Philly (Urban Dream Chasers),"293600",https://levelupphilly.org/,https://www.instagram.com/levelupphilly1/,,,,,"Level Up Philly is an interventional, holistic mentoring program for young people of color from the most high-risk sections of Philadelphia. Based on 20+ years of Pastor Aaron Campbell and Antioch of Calvary Chapel's (""Antioch"") outreach to the West Philadelphia community, Level Up Philly was launched in 2018. It is called Level Up because we meet each young person in their specific high-risk context, and then holistically equip them to ""level up"" to their next levels of success.
Drawing some 850 - 1,000 teens and young adults weekly (ages 13-25 years old), representing 81 different high schools, Level Up's mission is to rescue and raise up a generation amidst the city of Philadelphia's unprecedented gun violence crisis, juvenile poverty crisis, and failing public education crisis. With its 12,000 square foot facility located in the University City/West Philadelphia section of the city, Level Up provides the following services in its dynamic, safe space context: life-skills mentoring, academic tutoring, college prep, peer-to-peer mentoring, anti-retaliation negotiations [between warring neighborhoods], parole and court advocacy, job placement, ex offender aftercare, culinary and nutrition education, art and chess classes, and horticulture (in our adjoining 2,500 square foot community garden), dance classes, city-wide Level Up ""dance battle"" events, and more.
Level Up exists to not only confront the crisis, but to also create the restorative cultural shift<97>with a pioneering, restorative justice approach<97>to help redeem our city<92>s present and future. Level Up is unique in its approach, but it can be replicated and even appended to other like-minded works.",,Violence Interruption,"We excel in reducing gun violence and promoting positive transformation among Philadelphia's high-risk youth. We meet each young person in their specific high-risk context, and then holistically equip them to ""level up"" to their next levels of success.
Our program has redirected numerous violent gun carriers and drug dealers towards lawfulness, even drawing and reforming individuals directly from jail. We currently have 8 Level Up mentees who were ex-offenders pursuing their GED certification at our partner corporation, EDSI Solutions.<a0> One of our Level Up mentees (24 y/o male who had an F3 felony on his record and has been reformed by Level Up) has been hired by PepsiCo via our partnership and now makes $55K/year.<a0>
As we continue combatting the gun violence epidemic plaguing our high-risk young people in Philadelphia, we have found that along with our front lines anti-violence initiatives, we must supplement this by also providing hands-on educational training and academic tutoring that prepares them for college and/or career-path alternatives. In other words, as we are reforming these young people into non-violence ambassadors, there still remains a void in their lives<97>and a daily temptation to resort to their old ways<97>without also giving them a sustainable alternative. To that end, we have launched Level Up Academy, where 120+ of our teens and young adults meet once a week with our tech advancement instructors. They are learning video streaming and marketing, entrepreneurship with tech, intro to computer coding, video game development, and meta verse exploration with our virtual reality headsets. More so, there are tech companies who have already heard of our work and are interested in partnering and giving our kids jobs and internships. Our goal is to have all of our Level Up attendees exposed to the world of opportunities in tech, while preparing as many as we can for non-degreed career pipelines in tech.","We seek improvement in the following three areas: metrics/evaluation, board development, and fundraising.<a0><a0>
1) Metrics and Evaluation: We are looking for ways to capture Level Up<92>s groundbreaking success with a new set of metrics, beyond the traditional means of measuring performance. Behaviors are being changed and lives are being reformed and we want to be able to capture this data accordingly.
2) Board development: We currently have a working board in place and are looking for guidance on the best board composition and structure for our organization.
3) Fundraising: This remains a constant focus for us as our program is currently supported by donations. We are looking to move towards more sustainable means of funding as our program continues to expand.","4721 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19139","4721 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19139","2018",,,,,,,,Yes
Know Your Worth Girls Inc.,"30000",https://www.knowyourworthgirlsinc.org/,https://www.instagram.com/kywgirlsinc/,,,,,"Know Your Worth Girls Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that primarily focuses on empowering and supporting at-risk girls while extending support to youth and families in Philadelphia and the surrounding areas. Know Your Worth Girls Inc. promotes self-empowerment, skill development, mental health and wellness, community and civic engagement, and cultural enrichment traveling both domestically and internationally. Know Your Worth Girls Inc. offers programming and resources to underserved individuals. Below are two of its programs based on violence prevention, Black Girls N Sync and Hope-ish.

The mentoring program, Black Girls N Sync, targets bipoc girls ages 8-17, providing a safe haven for girls teaching self-empowerment, and promoting skill development activities to encourage personal growth & success. Black Girls N Sync is informed by the need to empower young girls in the area of jurisdiction by offering them guidance and opportunities to acquire basic skills that will improve the quality of their lives. A significant number of girls globally are vulnerable to environmental risks and discrimination because of the negative social perceptions and perspectives about their position in society. Thus, girls are endangered compared to boys. We hold workshops such as financial literacy, mindset development, sexual awareness, etiquette, and more, while also being involved in community engagement.

The mental health and wellness program, Hope-ish, aims to provide guidance and resources to black girls aged 10-17 who struggle with anxiety and trauma caused by gun violence. HOPE-ish addresses the leading problems that youth face today, including suicide, firearm homicide, and gun violence rates, especially in impoverished communities. With 95% of our program's girls not receiving services for trauma caused by gun violence, HOPE-ish seeks to make a difference. The goal is to raise awareness of the importance of mental health and help young women thrive and build resilience after tragedy. HOPE-ish aims to elevate the mindsets of youth from hopeless to HOPE-ish.

In addressing the impact of gun violence on our youth, we take into account how their environment has influenced their mindset development, whether proactively or adversely. Gun violence exposure is associated with increased levels of anxiety and depression in children. The National Survey on Children's Exposure to Violence found that over 60% of children exposed to violence, including gun violence, reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression. We aim to heal youth affected by providing opportunities to explore outside of their community, such as trail walks and various trips. Allowing them to develop self-worth & life skills through mentorship & fun educational workshops. Exposing the youth to community engagement, cultural enrichment, workforce development, and most importantly acquiring strong mental health. We differ from others because we create a secure and supportive environment for their growth and development. To equip them with essential life skills, while all still having fun. and creating a sense of unity amongst one another.

By caring for the caregivers, BuildaBridge provides socio-emotional support to deal with the stressors of facing multiple fronts of adversity associated with populations and neighborhoods plagued by gun violence. Since the COVID lockdown in March 2020, BuildaBridge has served over 400 people.

Self-Care is an essential practice that needs to be emphasized more in social service provision and general caregiving. While devoted to the well-being of those we serve, devotion to the self is also indispensable and not to be ignored. Ultimately, how we treat ourselves impacts ourselves and those around us. To remediate this, BuildaBridge International offers an arts-based approach to self-care for professionals. The professional development session incorporates BuildaBridge<92>s Safe Spaces Model and self-care practices. The trauma-informed, strength-based and person-centered pedagogy of the Safe Spaces Model is the foundation of all BuildaBridge programming. Experiential learning through various mediums of art-making and dialogue will open participants up to accessible and achievable strategies to maintain self-care in and around challenging environments.

Thomas Center for Learning and Physical Literacy Development,"272250",www.thomaslearning.org/green,https://www.instagram.com/thomaslearningpl/,https://www.facebook.com/ThomasLearningPL/,,,,"Thomas Center for Learning was founded in 2021 and with your support our Green Treat project will launch in Spring 2024. At the Green Treat Children<92>s garden, we will teach kids how to grow food and will provide a nature based play space. This is because we believe children must be given the opportunity to reconnect with and care for the Earth. There will be more capacity to care for one another if we take care of our physical and mental health by learning how to grow food and play safely outdoors. 

Gun violence prevention is a critical aspect of our mission at The Green Treat. Providing children with the opportunity to develop positive behaviors is the foundation of most efforts to prevent youth crime and violence. We will stand out by:

Creating a Safe Space- We believe that safe and green outdoor play spaces can act as sanctuaries for children. These spaces provide not only physical safety but also a sense of security and refuge from the dangers of gun violence that may lurk in their communities.

Promoting Mental Health and Coping Skills- Our nature-based play and outdoor activities have therapeutic benefits for children. Engaging with nature and physical activity can serve as a form of mental and emotional release, teaching children healthy ways to cope with stress and adversity, thus reducing the risk of turning to violence.


Education and Awareness-We believe that education is a powerful tool in preventing gun violence. While we focus on physical literacy and food security, we will also incorporate lessons on conflict resolution, tolerance, and non-violence into our programs.


Gun violence prevention and intervention are woven into the fabric of The Green Treat. Our holistic approach to child development aims to create a safer, more nurturing environment for children while addressing the underlying factors that contribute to violence. By teaching children physical literacy, providing green spaces, and empowering them to make healthy choices, we are helping build a foundation of strength, resilience, and non-violence in the communities we serve.
","We think deeply, critically, ethically and equitably about our youth and their families. We hope you consider our value and contributions to your program. Thank you for reviewing our application.",,"Our organization excels in several key areas that drive our mission and vision:

Promoting Physical Literacy for Children<a0>
We noticed a gap in our community's approach to educating school-aged children about the importance of physical literacy based on our founder's dissertation research. Our commitment to providing intentional classroom activities and role models who teach students about living a healthy, active life is at the core of our mission. We firmly believe that physical literacy goes beyond playgrounds and trees; it requires dedicated programs, and we're proud to be at the forefront of this effort. We excel in teacher professional development training, curriculum development, data collection and research methods.

Improving Children's Mental and Physical Well-Being
We understand that physical literacy is a social justice issue, especially among children of color. The statistics highlighting increased morbidity and mortality rates due to a lack of physical activity are alarming. By prioritizing nature-based play and green spaces, we are working to provide children with the mental, physical, and social developmental benefits they deserve. We are the only program in our neighborhood designed for increasing children's physical literacy. Our focus on physical literacy and the healthy mind-body connection is our prevention method against gun violence in our community. We excel in our communication of social justice issues in academic, professional spaces as well as with the community.

Giving Children Voice and Choice in their Community<a0>
We are committed to educating children and youth, giving them access to healthy foods and safe, clean green outdoor play spaces. Our goal is to grow with five classrooms every school year, starting with schools and child care programs in Germantown/Mt. Airy area of Philadelphia. We believe that children learn best from those they aspire to be like and those they interact with. This is why we teach kids how to prepare healthy meals using green foods, let them share recipes with their peers and offer a play space to build social skills. We excel in building student agency and youth leadership.

The Green Treat is dedicated to improving the lives of children in our community by addressing their physical literacy, mental and physical well-being, food insecurity, and by giving them a voice and choice in their community.","1. Engage and Partner with Legislators - At The Green Treat, we recognize the critical role that legislators play in shaping policies, securing resources, and advocating for the well-being of children and communities. Engaging and partnering with legislators is one area where we are committed to grow, as it can significantly enhance our mission of promoting physical literacy, mental well-being, food security, and gun violence prevention for youth.<a0>By focusing on engaging and partnering with legislators, we aim to build strong, collaborative relationships that will not only support our mission but also create a favorable policy environment for our initiatives. We firmly believe that this effort will contribute to a safer, healthier, and more promising future for the children and communities we serve. Together, through our involvement in the NW Philly Technical Assistance Program, with the support of legislators, we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of the next generation. Engaging with lawmakers and educating them about the benefits of our programs for children's well-being can lead to policy changes that support our goals.<a0>
2. Make Meaningful Connections & Promote Program Awareness-Another area where we can improve is the reach and accessibility of our programs. We plan to accomplish this through the use of community resources such as the NW Philadelphia Technical Assistance Program. We believe that our participation in your initiative will increase the accessibility of the Green Treat throughout Philadelphia's northwest region, as well as strengthen our relationships with the groups we hope to meet through your technical assistance program. We are confident that the Green Treat will contribute to your effort, which aims to foster mutual support, exchange resources, and create chances for collaborative progress in our community. We recognize that cooperating with community centers, schools, and organizations can assist us in expanding our reach and engaging with a larger audience.<a0>We will make better use of our time, strategy, and resources by collaborating to broaden our reach and have a bigger impact on our community in partnership with one another.
3. Ensure Safety and Quality of Play Space and Equipment-Our final point of growth is to improve our outside play materials and equipment. The quality of play equipment and materials are essential to the Green Treat's success. We are dedicated to ensuring that the equipment utilized in our outdoor play areas is not only safe, but also long-lasting and environmentally friendly. We will work to improve the selection and upkeep of play equipment and materials in order to provide a more inclusive, fun, safe, and long-lasting play environment for children and youth. To accomplish this, we plan on working with the NW Philly Technical Assistance Program to come up with approaches for obtaining financial support in collaboration, with the intention that the Green Treat outdoor play place will become a NW Philly landmark, community resource and extension of other programs in our area.

These areas of growth and improvement align with our commitment to creating a positive and lasting impact on the well-being of children and our community. By leveraging community resources, building legislative support, and addressing the quality of play equipment and materials, we can advance our mission and make a meaningful difference in the lives of the children we serve.

that provides a safe space for youth and families to develop positive life skills and nurture their
potential to break the cycle of poverty. Since 2010, NoMo has delivered a community-based
comprehensive anti-violence programming that provides participants, ages 12 -24 who are at an
elevated risk of gun violence involvement due to environmental influences and social factors
with increased confidence and improved social/emotional skills that lead to healthier individuals,
increased family stability, transitional housing, restorative practices, decreased substance abuse,
decrease in criminal activities, and a clear path to success. NoMo attempts to circumvent the
issues that plague our society by providing a plethora of opportunities that will allow them to
traverse the difficult paths of city living. NoMo provides comprehensive intakes that determine
the needs of young people and families. We offer group and individual counseling services to
address the issues facing our community. NoMo specializes in career development, financial

many acts of neglect, trauma, influences, and abuse from different avenues in the city of
Philadelphia. We meet our constituents where they are developmentally. We help them get to a
comforting positive space, where they can think and act rationally. The purpose of our efforts are
to break down the social and economic barriers our young people and community faces. We aim
to build on our current community-centered solutions and successes. For the last 11 years, we
have served over 1000 young people and over 300 justice-impacted families have been
reconciled. In our new transitional housing initiative, we have provided housing to 38 individuals
and aim to impact more. In meeting the diverse needs of our community, we provide drug and
substance abuse education and counseling to our population. One of our mantras is to provide
early intervention to aid in prevention and to teach positive habits before they solidify into
normal behaviors.

Anti-Drug & Alcohol Crusaders,"1000000",https://www.adacphilly.org/,https://www.instagram.com/adacphilly/,https://www.facebook.com/adacphilly,,,,"We offer a free school-based substance misuse and violence prevention program using evidence-based curricula. The name of our program is <93>Philly Youth Making Positive Choices<94>. For 35 years, our program was only delivering substance misuse and violence prevention curricula for its <93>out-of-school time<94> (OST) program to youth at our OST site located in West Philadelphia. We saw the need to serve more youth and families in the community, and the schools they<92>re connected to are where we can best reach them. We started off by offering our program to schools only in West and Southwest Philadelphia. We now offer and serve any school in Philadelphia. We have serve/serve schools in Northwest Philadelphia. Our PYMPC is in its 3rd year of programming. 

The purpose of our program is to educate young people on how to lead violence-free lives. We will focus on building protective factors within students to aid in positive social-emotional development while reducing risk factors that may lead to problem behaviors. ADAC<92>s intentions are to help youth be more accountable for their actions and the effects it has on others, all while teaching them the benefits of positive relationships, peace, unity, and love. Implementing this program will help youth learn how to think critically; evaluate, deal with and solve problems; how to consider other people<92>s viewpoints; and how to consider consequences of poor decisions. The goals of our program are:

Decrease/prevent the onset of youth violence in the community.
Increase youth<92>s knowledge on the implications of violence/gun violence.
Provide youth with the tools necessary to solve conflicts, communicate more effectively, and make positive choices overall.
Provide opportunities for youth to connect with their peers outside of school time to promote healthy relationships.
Provide youth with fun and engaging alternative activities. 
Promote healthy relationships among youth and their parents.
Engage youth who are most likely to be victims and/or perpetrators of violence/gun violence and provide those families with individualized supports (e.g., case management and service planning)
Provide families with resources, referrals, and support on youth behavior concerns, mental health, financial literacy, food, employment, housing, etc.
Improve relationship between families and school staff.
Increase community members<92> understanding on youth violence and get them more involved in violence prevention activities.

ADAC takes on a comprehensive prevention approach that will include services to reduce the risk of violence/gun violence on an individual, relationship, and community level. The major objectives of our program are:

Provide violence prevention education to youth ages 5-18 using evidence-based curriculum and general anti-violence information that will support the curriculum.
Provide alternative activities to youth ages 5-18 to prevent youth from participating in negative behaviors and keeping them safe.
Provide violence prevention education to the community and spread awareness on the risks of violence among youth and its effects on the community.
Provide families and communities with helpful information, resources, referrals, tips, etc. to help with their overall well-being. 

Our program target risk factors that increase the chances of youth to become future victims of delinquency, school dropout, violent behavior, and substance use. Our program is developed to build protective factors that will counteract all the negative outcomes because of their circumstances of living in poverty and in neighborhoods where rates of crime are high. Despite their situation, youth can overcome these negative outcomes, rise up, and become productive and successful citizens. Their situation doesn<92>t have to be permanent. With loving and trusting adults, appropriate services, and an engaged community, our youth do not have to fall victim to youth violence and other antisocial behaviors.

To complement our PYMPC program, we offer a free educational program to parents called Philly Families Thrive (PFT). PFT consist of parenting support and intervention on a one-to-one basis using an evidence-based curriculum and individual case management to parents and families with children who are beginning to engage in risky behaviors, experiencing trauma, showing signs of substance misuse, or experiencing a mental health illness or substance use disorder. For this service, the Practitioners use an evidence-based parenting curriculum. It is a parenting and family support system created to prevent, reduce, and treat behavioral and emotional problems in children and teenagers that lead to violence, drug use and other risky behaviors. The Practitioners provide 10 sessions to help parents identify the causes of their child<92>s misbehavior and establish personal goals for change. Parents learn a variety of parenting strategies to promote and develop positive behavior for their child. The program is appropriate for parents with children with moderate to severe levels of behavioral issues and for families who prefer one-on-one support. It aims to prevent problems in the family, school and community before they arise and to create family environments that encourage children to realize their potential. The program provides parents with useful strategies to assist them with managing their child<92>s behavior, learn parent coping skills, prevent serious problems from occurring, and establish healthy relationships. The program is designed to prevent inappropriate parenting practices and reduce risk factors (maltreatment, behavioral, emotional) in the family. Parents being equipped with family management and coping skills will decrease some of the mental challenges parents experience.","One of my concerns are maintaining staff. They don't remain because they find a job that pays more than we do and provide better health benefits. ADAC is not a rich organization, that can compete with some of the bigger non-profit organizations. We'll spend lots of time to train and get them ready, even spend money on them for specific training, get them ready for the mission and purpose, but something better comes there way. There has been sometimes, they ended up not being the ""right fit"" for ADAC. How do you find and maintain the right fit?

I do know that ADAC will benefit from this great TA program. It will really help the Executive Director. It will strengthen our organization during this time of expansion and development of our programs. Please consider us. I'll be more than happy to talk with you and tell you more about our programs and services, about ADAC in general, and why we really need this TA service. Either way, thanks for offering this opportunity.","Educational Outreach, Case Management, Community Events, Data-informed Decision Making","1.

(Every Murder Is Real) Healing Center has provided victim<92>s advocacy, support, education, counseling, and wellness services to the families of homicide victims. EMIR Healing Center<92>s unique approach in providing trauma-informed, infused, and recovery services to families of homicide victims in Philadelphia, aligns with evidence-based strategies for engaging individuals who have experienced or witnessed homicide, gun violence, or other violent crime. Studies have shown that families who experience homicide are much less likely to be involved in retaliatory violence when strategies are employed that increase pro-social bonds, promote anti-violence norms, and provide social support for participants. EMIR Healing Center has been a leader in Philadelphia providing such services to families.
We provide a variety of services to families of homicide victims. While other agencies may provide services to a person, EMIR Healing Center focuses on families, recognizing that the trauma of homicide impacts the entire family system. We address the intergenerational aspects of trauma, particularly for children or teenagers, who have lost a loved one and may also lose the care and attention of other adults in their family who are deeply grieving. We offer compassionate care to families through staff, peers, contractors, and board members, some of whom themselves experienced homicide in the past. EMIR Healing Center also promotes radical self-care in all we do for clients, families, staff, peers, contractors, and all those we serve. We promote healing through the active prevention of re-traumatization and vicarious trauma. EMIR Healing Center has been recognized for our unique approach to care through numerous awards, news articles, foundations, and religious organizations. 
Clients who utilize counseling services are assessed at regular intervals utilizing our trauma checklist, which measures the types of trauma experienced, the intensity of trauma symptoms, and the impact of trauma on activities of daily living including school and/or work. We also refer clients to other services if more intense treatment is needed.

EMIR violence prevention programs are place based and address root causes of violence. We offer trauma support for communities impacted by violence. EMIR creates alternative ways to heal and teach how to identify what activates (triggers ) and emotion and healthy coping mechanism. 

Our Intervention & Prevention program's goal are to assist black men and boys who have been exposed to gun violence and
homicide though community engagement and mentorship to reduce gun violence rates in the future. This

trauma, leadership development, conflict resolution, and alternatives to violence skills.
? Gun Violence Prevention Seminars <96> The Brother to Brother workshop/seminars are created for

In our gym youth access mindset coaching, mindfulness techniques, emotional regulation practices, and a haven filled with creativity to develop self-esteem, self-worth, and resilience. They also learn to box, reducing stress and improving whole-body health. With trusted coaches who share their lived experiences on the streets of Philadelphia, our team helps children and youth build authentic relationships.

We were founded in 2009 and have served 1113 individuals to date. Distinctive methods that make our program stand out is the CBT and DBT therapy we offer to all students to improve their mental health while still giving them the necessary work skills needed to excel in a CDL, HVAC or retail career. We give a SEPTA transportation card to ease the burden of getting to the program as well as a cash stipend for simply showing up. Everyone is fed lunch. We have started an Alumni Association for graduates to stay in touch with us and each other. They meet monthly for fellowship and planning activities to give back to the community. For example: They are starting to adopt neighborhoods that they will go and clean up -- some of these areas are the same places they committed their own crimes in. They will be partnering up with the local police station in that neighborhood to develop a more positive relationship with law enforcement and for law enforcement to get to know them better and support them living a new-crime-free life post-prison. We also have recently created a men's support group as we hear from graduates they often have a sense of loneliness post prison and find it hard to connect with people (often times because those people may still be leading a crime-filled life.) A mental health clinician will facilitate those meetings. We also have a program funded by the Philadelphia's District Attorney's office for at risk youth which is taught online (for now.) We launched an additional at-risk youth program that is in person in Abington, Montgomery County. This is not funded through the DA's office as it is in Montgomery County and we are currently seeking funding for it. This program stemmed from high school gang infighting at Abington High School. We are working in tandem with the local police, a local church and the school district to offer an after-school program on site at a church (they donate their space to us.) The program is initially focusing on crises management, trauma/grief therapy and will segway into character building and developing leadership traits. Students will have an onsite tutor for homework help, participate in group activities including physical fitness. DInner is provided for all before returning home. Parents have skin in the game too as we offer a Parents Support Group. There is so much more to share about what we do and how we do it.

As Service Coordinators, we closely assess clients' needs, identify available resources, and help them access these resources. When individuals can't meet their basic needs, they resort to other survival strategies (U.S. Department of Justice, 2014). Our services include but are not limited to benefits, education, programming, employment, food, wellness, and housing in under-resourced communities. One key service organized by The PLUG is the Blueprint Social Development Institute, an innovative paid educational initiative empowering high school students through expanded extracurricular experiences, trade, servant leadership, financial literacy, mediation, and professional development, enabling them to design their futures and positively impact their communities. This holistic, client-centered, and community-focused approach distinguishes The PLUG<92>s programming as a comprehensive solution for fostering a safer, more equitable, and just society. The PLUG received its 501c3 status in early 2023. However, these services have been offered since 2017 in collaboration with schools, nonprofits, and other community spaces, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to serving the community.
